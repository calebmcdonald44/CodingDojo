/* The first thing to do would be to separate categorize each individual word
as such- meaning create a list of every word in the document. Every word
that is between double quotes (" ") would need to be omitted, since a
character in a story saying "he" doesn't mean the story is in third person. */

/* Then iterate through the list of words and log all uses of first, second
and third person pronouns in separate buckets. */

/* Whichever bucket contains the most words is the POV the story is written
in. */

/* I think the hardest part of problem solving (in this instance) was trying
to describe the process without actually using coding language. */
