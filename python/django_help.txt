(Might have to install Django globally somehow to make it work outside of Django folder, had issues with that previously)

(Do this in VSCode terminal)
SET UP AND ACTIVATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

INSTALL DJANGO
pip install django
pip install python-dotenv

SET UP A DJANGO PROJECT ON THE SAME LEVEL
(DON'T FORGET THE PERIOD) django-admin startproject <projectname> .

UPDATE IMPORTS
Add to settings.py-
- import os
- from dotenv import load_dotenv
- load_dotenv()

HIDE SECRET KEY
Create .env on top level
Define SECRET_KEY in .env (no spaces or quotations)
SECRET_KEY = str(os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')) in settings.py
Create .gitignore with .env and venv in it

START A DJANGO APP
python manage.py startapp <appname>
Add app name to settings.py "installed_apps"
create urls.py file in app (with proper imports)

MIGRATE (must do anytime changes are made to models.py)
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
- To enter Django shell to manually alter database:
	- python manage.py shell
	- from <app_name>.models import *

RUN SERVER
python manage.py runserver
